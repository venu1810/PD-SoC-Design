# PD-SoC-Design
The phase of the computer chip creation process where the precise physical architecture of the circuitry is decided upon is referred to as physical design. To put it another way, it's similar to creating the schematic or map that shows how all the tiny electronic parts (such as wires and transistors) are going to be placed on a computer chip.
